# DanarchySys

Welcome to dAnarchy Systems! This gem will assist you in easing the setup of OpenStack instances for use of hosting various web applications.

## Installation

Proper installation has not yet been set up. You will first need to set up an OpenStack connection configuration at your $HOME/.danarchysys_connection.rb which should contain something like this:

# Connection Settings for OpenStack
class Connection<br />
<br />
  def self.openstack<br />
    @os_connection_params = {<br />
      openstack_auth_url:       "http://openstack-provider.com:5000/v2.0/tokens",<br />
      openstack_username:       "openstack_username",<br />
      openstack_api_key:        "openstack_api_key",<br />
      openstack_tenant:         "openstack_tenant",<br />
    }<br />
  end<br />
end<br />
<br />
Once you have created ~/.danarchysys_connection.rb, simply run 'bin/danarchy_sys' to initiate the DanarchySys CLI.
