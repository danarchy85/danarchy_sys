# DanarchySys

Welcome to dAnarchy Systems! This gem will assist you in easing the setup of OpenStack instances for use of hosting various web applications.

## Installation

Requires bundler to be installed already: 'gem install bundler'

<<<<<<< HEAD
Download danarchy_sys, 'cd' into its directory, then run 'sh bin/setup'.\n
This will run bundler and install the required gems. It will then prompt for a new OpenStack setup.\n

dAnarchySys config setup will be located at danarchy_sys/config/danarchysys.yml in YAML format like this:\n

:connections:\n
  :your_connection:\n
    :openstack_auth_url: "http://openstack-provider.com:5000/v2.0/tokens"\n
    :openstack_username: "openstack_username"\n
    :openstack_api_key: "openstack_api_key"\n
    :openstack_tenant: "openstack_tenant"\n
:settings:\n
  :ssh_key_path: PATH_TO_SSH_KEYS\n
