# DanarchySys

Welcome to dAnarchy Systems! This gem will assist you in easing the setup of OpenStack instances for use of hosting various web applications.

## Installation

Requires bundler to be installed already: 'gem install bundler'

Download danarchy_sys, 'cd' into its directory, then run 'sh bin/setup'.  
This will run bundler and install the required gems. It will then prompt for a new OpenStack setup.  

dAnarchySys config setup will be located at danarchy_sys/config/danarchysys.yml in YAML format like this:

:connections:  
  :your_connection:  
    :openstack_auth_url: http://openstack-provider.com:5000/v2.0/tokens  
    :openstack_username: openstack_username  
    :openstack_api_key: openstack_api_key
